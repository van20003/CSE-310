# Development Environment
The only tool that was needed for this project was Visual Studio Code. Using the python extension, I was able to write a simple line of python that output my desired result. 

Python is a basic programming language that is great to use to learn and output text or strings. Just using the simple function of “print”, you are able to output text in a simple manner.
