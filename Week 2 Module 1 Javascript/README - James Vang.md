# Overview

I am using software called Visual Studio Code to create my code. I chose this program because it is free and is widely used with a lot of support. We will be focusing on Javascript today.

The pupose of this is to help create a simple "Tip Calculator". This will be helpful for times where you need to calculate a tip for any occasion that requires. It will show simple fundamentals on how to input Javascript into html.

# Development Environment
The only tool that was needed for this project was Visual Studio Code. Using the Vidual Code, I was able to write a simple program that includes html and javascript.

Javascript is programming language that can be used to help web pages (html) become interactive. This is not limited to but uncludes inputing text/values and buttons that will trigger functions to display a result for the viewer.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- One thing that would have added more to my project was more javascript. I could have made it more complex and calulate more things, for example splitting the bill between people.
- Another thing I could have added for more code work was to maybe add options for different paying methods.
- I think that something I could fix too is usiong more complex methods or making the code more challenging. This code was fairly simple. Even though it should the use and simple understanding of Javascript, I would have liked to use more time to make it more advanced.
